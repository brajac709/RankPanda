# This class handles the creation of splines.
# A Cubic Hermite Spline can be defined by a list of points and their slopes.
# Once all these points and slopes are had, a smooth spline is defined between
# each consecutive two points.
# Let x(t) be a spline between two points, xi and xj (j = i + 1).
# Let the slope at xi be mi and the slope at xj be mj.
# Then, x(t) is defined as:
# x(t) = (2t^3 - 3t^2 + 1)xi + (t^3 - 2t^2 + t)mi + (-2t^3 + 3t^2)xj + (t^3 - t^2)mj
# Repeat to get y(t).
# When you shift t from 0 to 1, x(t) and y(t) will generate a smooth curve
# between each pair of points.  Further, the curves will all be smooth with
# the one next to them, as the slopes are equal.
# The splines are saved in a simple format; see below.

# TODO(astory): convert to module level functions.  None of these actually take
# advantage of, or have any reason for, being in a class.

    # This calculated what the slopes at the points should be for the splines.
    # The method we use simply draws a straight line between the point before
    # and the point after, and this becomes the slope of the point.
    # Note that the slopes are dx/dt and dy/dt, not dx/dy.
